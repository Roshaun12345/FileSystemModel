This project simulates a basic file system that allows users to interact with files and directories through the command line. It enables users to create files, list directories, view file contents, remove files and folders, and navigate between directories.

Features
Create: Add new files and folders to the file system.

List: Display all files and folders in the current directory.
Change Directory (cd): Navigate between directories.
Print Working Directory (PWD): Display the current directory path.
View File Content (cat): Print the content of a file.
Remove File: Delete a file from the current directory.
Remove Folder: Delete a folder from the current directory.
Disk Usage (du): Display the total size of the current directory and its contents.

To run the file system simulation, execute the FileSys class in your IDE or from the command line. The program will prompt you with a prompt> message, awaiting user input.
